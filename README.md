# Anderson and Galambos 2019
Metabolic dynamics of Bacteria and Archaea at the Mid-Cayman Rise. Data and scripts for work done by Rika Anderson and David Galambos 2017-2018.

This README is organized based on the figures and tables in the paper. Each figure/table gets its own section detailing which data were used, which scripts were used to create the figure, and run instructions + dependencies for those scripts. Please contact [Rika Anderson](mailto:randerson@carleton.edu) with any questions or bug fixes.
