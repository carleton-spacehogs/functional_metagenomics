Metabolic dynamics of Bacteria and Archaea at the Mid-Cayman Rise. Data and scripts for work done by Rika Anderson and David Galambos 2017-2018.

##MAGs
*anvio_bin_summary: The output of `anvi-summarize` for each sample.
*anvi_refine: The results of manual refinement of the MAGs in FS854 using `anvi-refine`
*anvio_MAG_meancov_data: The mean coverage of each MAG, as calculated by anvi'o
*bin_collections: Files describing which MAGs belong to which samples
*MCR_bin_fasta: FASTA files of the contigs contained in each MAG
*MCS_data: Module completion score (MCS) analysis for each MAG
##mapping
A folder for each sample that includes BAM files; individual profiles for each mapping created using anvi'o; and a merged profile for the whole sample. 
##sample_data
*contigs: Contigs FASTA files for each sample and \*db files from anvio.
*DNA_reads
*RNA_reads
