# Anderson and Galambos 2019

## Summary
The folders are organized based on which kinds of data are being compared. Each folder contains the scripts for those kinds of data.

`MAGs-samples` contains the scripts used to compile and plot the data comparing MAG expression across different samples.

`genes-samples` is for calculating the community-level expression and abundance of genes across samples.

Finally, `MCS-MAGs` is used to calculate the *module completion score* of each MAG.

All scripts are written in Python 3.6.2.
